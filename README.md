# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch web app
In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

- create a 16x16 grid
- set up hover animations to color in boxes
- create buttons for different colors/erase function
